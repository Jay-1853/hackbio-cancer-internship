**The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and Its Relevance to Cancer**

Francis Crick's seminal paper “On Protein Synthesis” first postulated the central dogma of molecular biology in 1958. It specified the direction of the flow of genetic information in living systems. **<sup>**7**</sup>** In his paper, Crick puts it this way: “...once ‘information’ has passed into protein _it cannot get out again_.”**<sup>**7**</sup>** He went further to state in the same paper that while biological information can flow from one nucleic acid to another or from nucleic acid to protein, information cannot flow from protein to protein or from protein to nucleic acid.**<sup>**6,7**</sup>** Essentially, it can be said that the transfer of biological information between nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and proteins in living systems is unidirectional, meaning, information can only flow from DNA to RNA to protein in cells and not vice versa. In living cells, DNA directs the synthesis of proteins with the RNA as an intermediary. When the cell requires a protein to carry out one of its living processes, it signals the copy of the nucleotide sequence of the relevant portion of the genome needed to make the protein into RNA.**<sup>**5**</sup>** This process is called transcription. The RNA transcript is then used as a template to synthesize the needed protein **<sup>**5**</sup>**. This process is called translation.

The central dogma of molecular biology is fundamental to understanding many aspects of human health, including cancer development. In cancer, mutations in nucleotide sequences in the DNA and alterations in transcription and translation can produce abnormal proteins that disrupt normal cell growth regulation.**<sup>**4** </sup>**This disruption may cause the cell to grow and divide uncontrollably, potentially leading to cancer. The mutated versions of normal genes that promote cell growth and division are called oncogenes. When activated, oncogenes drive uncontrolled cell proliferation, one of the hallmarks of cancer. An example of such oncogenes is HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2).**<sup>**3**</sup>** HER2 is amplified in certain breast cancers, leading to the upregulation of the HER2 protein.**<sup>**2,3**</sup>** This causes the continuous activation of cell signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival, contributing to aggressive tumor growth.**<sup>**2,3**</sup>**

It is, however, not all doom and gloom in the relevance of the central dogma to cancer. Our understanding of central dogma's role in oncogenesis can be exploited to combat cancer. By targeting the processes involved in the central dogma, various therapeutic strategies have been developed to treat cancer. One of the tools that exploit the central dogma is the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool that has been used since its discovery to correct errors in the genome and restore the function of tumor suppressor genes.**<sup>**1**</sup>**
